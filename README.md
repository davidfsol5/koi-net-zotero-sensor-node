# koi-net-zotero-sensor-node

Zotero Sensor project to create a sensor in python caapable of extracting long form test and metadata for citations stored in a local Zotero database. The sensor periodically polls the database to detect new citations, updated citations and deleted citations.

This repo was forked from the BlockScience repo [koi-net-node-template](https://github.com/BlockScience/koi-net-node-template)

# Modifying this Node
Take a look at the [koi-net repo](https://github.com/BlockScience/koi-net) for documentation about the koi-net package and developing nodes. This template provides the basic structure for a full node setup. You'll likely want to start by modifying `config.py` with the RID types your node deals with, and adding some new knowledge handlers in `handlers.py`.
